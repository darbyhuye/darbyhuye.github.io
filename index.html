Im a second year Ph.D. Student in the [D.O.C.C. Lab](https://docclab.cs.tufts.edu/index.html) at Tufts University studying under the guidance of Professor Raja Sambasivan. My research interests involve leveraging distributed tracing for debugging performance problems in cloud systems. 

# Ongoing Projects

[SOK: Identifying Mismatches Between Microservice Testbeds and Industrial Perceptions of Microservices (Seshagiri and Huye et al., JSys'22)](https://docclab.cs.tufts.edu/papers/seshagiri2022_paper.pdf)
Microservices are widely used to build distributed systems in industry. Academics are left in the dark when doing research in this space as we do not have access to these industrial microservice applications. Many researchers have attempted to make test applications for researchers to use, but these applications are designed using narrow design decisions, that are not necessaraly representative of the decide decisions made in their industrial counterparts. We interviewed folks in industry about their experiences with microservices and compared these applications with the testbeds. 

[Automating instrumentation choices for performance
problems in distributed applications with VAIF (Toslali et al., SOCC '21)](https://docclab.cs.tufts.edu/papers/toslali-socc21.pdf)
If we lived in a world where every line of code in a system had instrumentation describing it, we would have complete visibility into the system that would allow us to easily identify sources of performance issues. However, this is infeasble due to information overload (on the system and the human interpreting it). 

# Me in the outside world
Beyond research, I have many hobbies including hiking, kayaking, and sewing (peep some of my sewing projects [here](https://www.instagram.com/darbysews/)).
