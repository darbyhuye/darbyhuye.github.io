    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm a second year Ph.D. Student in the <a href="https://docclab.cs.tufts.edu/index.html">D.O.C.C. Lab</a> at Tufts University
studying under the guidance of Professor Raja Sambasivan. My research interests involve leveraging distributed tracing
for debugging performance problems in cloud systems.</p>

<h3>Ongoing Projects</h3>
<p>Analyzing Meta's Microservice Architecture and request workflows</p>

<p>LeitMotif: Discovering emergent frequent patterns in microservice architectures</p>

<h3>Publications</h3>
<p><a href="https://docclab.cs.tufts.edu/papers/seshagiri2022_paper.pdf">SOK: Identifying Mismatches Between Microservice Testbeds and Industrial Perceptions of Microservices (Seshagiri and
Huye et al., JSys'22)</a>
Microservices are widely used to build distributed systems in industry. Academics are left in the dark when doing
research in this space as we do not have access to these industrial microservice applications. Many researchers have
attempted to make test applications for academic use, but these applications are designed using narrow design
decisions that are not necessarily representative of the design decisions made in their industrial counterparts. We
interviewed folks in industry about their experiences with microservices and compared these applications with the
academic testbeds.</p>

problems in distributed applications with VAIF (Toslali et al., SOCC
'21)</a>
If we lived in a world where every line of code in a system had instrumentation describing it, we would have complete
visibility into the system that would allow us to easily identify sources of performance issues. However, this is
infeasble due to information overload (on the system and the human interpreting it).</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>Beyond research, I have many hobbies including hiking, kayaking, and sewing (peep some of my sewing projects <a href="https://www.instagram.com/darbysews/">here</a>).</p>
